    Compressed QSA additionally pins page_size=64: its compressed cache is
    addressed as ``full_slot // compress_ratio`` (the DSV4 scheme), which
    requires page-aligned full-KV allocation with the page a multiple of the
    compress ratio, and page-granular prefix sharing so shared pages share
    their compressed slots. MambaRadixCache supports page_size > 1 only with
    the mamba extra-buffer strategy, so fall back to the family default when
    neither that nor --disable-radix-cache holds (the QSA pool then fails
    fast at boot).
